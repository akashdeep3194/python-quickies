* ## Basic Python Functions

  * ### *Common Binary Tree Functions:*

    ```
    class BinaryTreeNode:
        def __init__(self, val):
            self.val = val
            self.left = None
            self.right = None
    ```

  * **Ways to print Trees:**
    * Print Pre Order Traversal of a Binary tree
    * Print In Order Traversal of a Binary tree
    * Print Post Order Traversal of a Binary tree
    * Print Level Wise Tree Traversal of a Binary tree

  * **Take Level Wise Input in a Binary Tree (-1 denotes no child)**  
  * **Find the Lowest Common Ancestor between two nodes of a Binary Tree Node**


* ## Basic Algorithms

  * ### *01 Knapsack:*

  * **Given the following problem:**
    * A Knapsack of given capacity (W)
    * An array of value of items
    * An array of weight of items
    * Return the maximum sum of values of the items that can be held in the Knapsack at a time
